            Ever wanted a little more comfort while sitting in class? OTC will now offer a cuddly companion while you
            attend class. Each class will be assigned 6 bunnies and a caretaker which will be a student intern assigned
            to the position. If you are interested in caring for the new fluffy friends please email the campus at
            bunnieinterns@otc.school or call 417-417-0000. This addition is expected to happen in the beginning of the
            Spring 2026 semester. The bunnies are being donated from a local farm that has bred and raised these bunnies
            for 15 years. The bunnies are going to be a range of colors but all the cutest they can be. So far students
            have all praised the change and everyone is excepting this change to be a positive impact on student
            behaviors and moods in the classroom.
